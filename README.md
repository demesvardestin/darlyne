## Darlyne

Darlyne is a simple, super watered-down rack-based web framework. It was built
as a follow up to Adam Gamble's [tutorial](https://isotope11.com/blog/build-your-own-web-framework-with-rack-and-ruby-part-2 "Isotope Eleven")
on [Isotope Eleven](https://isotope11.com).

I've added my own comments and remarks to explain some of the key steps in
the process.

### Installation & Usage

Fork/Clone this repo, run ```bundle install```, then run ```rackup``` within
this project's directory.

### Todo

This app can't currently serve static files, and is not available from the command
line. Hoping to handle both these things next.
