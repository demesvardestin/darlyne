## Darlyne

Darlyne is a simple, super watered-down rack-based web framework. It was built
as a follow up to Adam Gamble's [tutorial](https://isotope11.com/blog/build-your-own-web-framework-with-rack-and-ruby-part-2 "Isotope Eleven")
on [Isotope Eleven](https://isotope11.com).

I've added my own comments and remarks to explain some of the key steps in
the process.

### Installation & Usage

Fork/Clone this repo, run ```bundle install```, then run ```rackup``` within
this project's directory.

### Todo

This app is not available from the command line. So rails-like commands
such as ```darlyne new```, though convenient, are not yet implemented. I'm hoping
to package this as a gem at some point.
